invisible cities - CS 7450 Information Visualization Project
The intention of the system is to visualize how the Chicago subway network evolves over time and to identify patterns of behavior. Also, problems in the network can be detected by exploring its details and the correlation between its variables.

The main visualization will consist on a topology map of the different stations (subway or bus stations) and the connections between them. However, the different shape, size and color of the different stations and connections will be encoding different attributes of the data, providing an effective way of visualizing several variables and their correlations at the same time. Then, mechanisms will be added in order to explore further details of the data. With all, the application will tell a story about the transportation network and will let the user explore that story.
